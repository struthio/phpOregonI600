PHP Implementation of Weather OS Server

Backround

Some time ago I bought Oregon Scientific I600 weather station.

Thanks to http://users.skynet.be/luc.pauwels/luc/weatheros/ I was able to recreate pages that Weather OS was serving to client and thanks to that I have working I600 unit.

Requirements

Script was tested with following software:

Apache (with url rewrite module)
PHP 5.5.9 (with modules: )

It is required that script is available under:

http://<your_host>/mds
